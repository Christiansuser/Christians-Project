        <p>Hello! My name is Christian. I have one younger brother, who is seen in the image next to this text box. During the time of this websites making, I am 16 years old and a rising senior in high school. I play many sports such as basketball,tennis, and soccer. I also have other hobbies such as building computers, playing chess, and cooking. I currently live in New York with my bother and my parents, however I hope to one day travel the world, as I havent been to many countries or states so far. Hopefully in the future, Ill be able to start a successful business and buy<br> all of my dream cars.</p>
