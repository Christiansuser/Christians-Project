                The Virgin Islands, located in the Caribbean Sea, are divided into two main groups: the United States Virgin Islands (USVI) and the British Virgin Islands (BVI). Known for their pristine white sandy beaches, crystal-clear waters, and vibrant coral reefs, the islands attract visitors seeking relaxation and water-based activities such as snorkeling and sailing. Each group of islands has its own unique charm, with the USVI offering a blend of American and Caribbean cultures, while the BVI are known for their quieter, more exclusive resorts and sailing opportunities.
